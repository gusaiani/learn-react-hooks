## Learn React Hooks

In this repo I work on the book [Learn React Hooks](https://www.packtpub.com/web-development/learn-react-hooks), specifically the Blog project.

It's a `create-react-app` project, below are the fundamental commands you can run.

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.


### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you canâ€™t go back!**
